# Send a File to QLab

Follow these steps to send your newly created CSV file over to QLab.

## Open QLab

Open an empty QLab workspace.

:::note
CSV to QLab will operate with both QLab 3 and QLab 4, however not all functions are available on QLab 3.
:::

## If you are using QLab 5 and have an OSC Passcode.

* Select the checkbox for QLab5.
* Enter passcode found in QLab settings.

:::tip
Make sure that the passcode has full access to the workspace.
Note that it is also possible to bypass this step and allow access with the "no passcode" option.
:::


## Find the IP address

You will need the local IP address of the machine running QLab.

:::tip
You can run CSV to QLab on the same machine.
:::

On QLab 4 you can find this in Settings -> OSC Controls.


## Fill out the form
Enter the IP address and select your file in CSV to QLab keeping the QLab workspace open.


## Submit the Form

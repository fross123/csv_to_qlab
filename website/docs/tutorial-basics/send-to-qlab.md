# Send a File to QLab

Follow these steps to send your newly created CSV file over to QLab.

## Open QLab

Open an empty QLab workspace.

:::note
CSV to QLab will operate with both QLab 4 and QLab 5, however not all functions are available on QLab 4.
:::

## Select your QLab version.
* There are not many differences, but QLab 5 handles some incoming messages slightly differently.


## If you have an OSC Passcode.

* Select the checkbox for passcode.
* Enter passcode found in QLab settings.

:::tip
Make sure that the passcode has full access to the workspace.
Note that it on QLab 5is also possible to bypass this step and allow access with the "no passcode" option.
:::


## Find the IP address

You will need the local IP address of the machine running QLab.

:::tip
You can run CSV to QLab on the same computer as QLab by using "127.0.0.1".
:::


## Fill out the form
Enter the IP address and select your file in CSV to QLab keeping the QLab workspace open.


## Submit the Form
